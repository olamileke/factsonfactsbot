(AP Photo/Juan Karita) | AP Photo/Juan Karita\nClaver-Carone, for his part, welcomes all the attention around his nomination as a chance to draw attention to the little-discussed bank.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use that sudden interest that has sparked across the board among Republicans and Democrats and put it to work for the benefit of the IDB,\u201d Claver-Carone said in an interview. \u201cThe winner is going to be the IDB because now everyone, whether because they like me or they don\u2019t like me, [is] going to want to be the biggest champions of the IDB.\u201d\n MOST READ\n Kamala Harris\nHarris 'electrifies' West Indian voters \u2014 and gives Biden a new edge in Florida\nTrump the distracter brings his act to the DNC\nHHS chief information officer abruptly resigns\nPentagon establishes new task force to investigate UFOs\nPompeo lashes out as U.N.

They also want the U.S. to withdraw its candidacy to allow for a Latin American to take the job.\n\n\u201cThat is the prudent step. And at that time, the U.S. government, whether led by President Trump or President Biden, should return to the well-established norm that the IDB\u2019s president be a Latin American. If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d former Secretary of State George Shultz and five other former officials wrote in an op-ed published last week in major Latin American newspapers, like Reforma in Mexico and Clar\u00edn in Argentina.\n\nThe U.S. already has significant power within the bank, which is headquartered in Washington, as it has a 30 percent share \u2014 meaning it has de facto veto power. Tradition holds that the executive vice president spot in the bank\u2019s leadership is reserved for a U.S. pick.\n\nA group of former Latin American presidents, including Colombia's Juan Manuel Santos and Brazil\u2019s Fernando Henrique Cardoso, have also called for countries to oppose the U.S. nominee and keep the tradition of having a Latin American leading the bank.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to further complicate the already difficult episode that Latin America and the Caribbean confronts due to the pandemic and its grave economic and social consequences,\u201d they wrote in June.\n\nPart of their issue with Claver-Carone\u2019s candidacy, former IDB officials said, also hinges on his ability to get Congress to support giving more money to the bank, as it is the largest source of development funding in the region.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has already made clear that Claver-Carone is \u201cthe wrong nominee to make the case for such an increase,\u201d noting his unpopularity with key members of Congress. Leahy\u2019s role in allocating money could make it difficult for Claver-Carone to lock in the money he wants for the bank.\n\n\u201cIt is important to be aware that this nomination could jeopardize United States support for, and cooperation with, that institution,\u201d Leahy said in a statement in June.\n\n VOA Building\nMEDIA\nTrump appointee deepens purge of U.S. global media agency\nBY DANIEL LIPPMAN\nOther influential lawmakers have offered mixed reactions to Claver-Carone\u2019s nomination.
