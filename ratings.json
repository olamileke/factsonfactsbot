The former university leader's wife, Becki, has served on the advisory board of Women for Trump.\n\nThe board\u2019s statement said that the past week, which also marked the beginning of classes for Liberty students at the Lynchburg, Va., campus, had \u201cchallenged all of us to the core.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome may say that all the signs were there for a long time before last week,\" the statement said. \"It\u2019s certainly fair to say that there were questionable comments made, worrying behavior, and inappropriate social media posts, but all the signs were not there until the start of last week. While we still didn\u2019t know the full scope of the matter, we have learned enough about the past to know that we had no choice but to take the leadership of Liberty University in a new direction.\u201d\n\nFalwell submitted his resignation last week, at the request of the university\u2019s board, in the wake of allegations that he and his wife, Becki, had engaged in an ongoing relationship with Giancarlo Granda, a former pool attendant at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Fla. Falwell has denied that he was involved, though Granda has repeatedly said in media interviews over the past week that Falwell observed Granda\u2019s sexual encounters with Becki.\n\nA former Liberty University student also claimed Becki Falwell initiated a sexual encounter with him in 2008, when she was a university employee and he was 22, POLITICO reported Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJerry Falwell Jr. took a leave of absence earlier in August, after he posted and removed a photo of himself vacationing on a yacht with his pants unzipped and his arm around his wife\u2019s assistant.\n\nPOLITICO previously reported that some members of Liberty\u2019s board were disturbed by Falwell\u2019s oversight of university funds, including his repeated trips on that yacht, which belongs to NASCAR owner Rick Hendrick.\n\nHendrick owns a racing team Liberty University spends roughly $6 million a year to sponsor. Use of the yacht was not part of the contract between Liberty and Hendrick\u2019s company, a Hendrick Motorsports representative previously told POLITICO.\n\nFalwell has also been dogged over the past several years by questions about Liberty University business deals that benefited his friends, including his personal trainer. Current and former Liberty University officials also described a culture of fear at the university and concerns about Falwell\u2019s behavior.\n\nOn Monday, the university\u2019s board said it had hired one of the \u201cleading forensic firms\u201d to investigate Falwell\u2019s tenure at the school, though a university spokesperson declined to say which firm.\n\nThe university board is in the process of beginning a search for a permanent replacement for Falwell. Jerry Prevo, a retired Alaska pastor and longtime board member, has been serving as acting head of the school.\n\nThe board said on Monday that it is also examining options to create a new role within senior leadership at the university for a \u201cspiritual coach\u201d and \u201cmentor\u201d to help guide the school.\n\nFalwell is a lawyer and real estate developer, rather than a minister, like his father, the late Rev.
