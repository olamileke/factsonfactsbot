Hey there! I can help you identify fake news articles. With me, you can be sure what you are reading is fact based. Simply send me a link to an article you want me to check, or send me a message here.
Take note that any message you send me must be at least 500 words. Alternatively, you can add me to your
group chats and have me check links and articles sent to the chat. I'll also check for fake news in messages with 
political content.
Important to note - I work best with political content. Fact away!
